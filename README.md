## "Discontinuous transition to loop formation in optimal supply network" 
## Franz Kaiser, Henrik Ronellenfitsch and Dirk Witthaut

This Computer Code should be used together with the associated [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02910). It serves to find the dissipation-optimal capacities for networks under cost constraints.

Each script is named after the Figure in the manuscript for whose creation it may be used.

The code is written in *python* and makes use of *numpy, scipy* and *networkx*.
