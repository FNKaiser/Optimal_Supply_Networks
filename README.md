This Computer Code should be used together with the associated [manuscript](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19567-2). It serves to find the dissipation-optimal capacities for networks under cost constraints.

Each script is named after the Figure in the manuscript for whose creation it may be used.

The code for the fluctuation model is written in *python* and makes use of *numpy, scipy* and *networkx*.
The code for the damage model is written in *Julia* and makes use of *LightGraphs.jl* and *NLsolve.jl*.
