This Computer Code should be used together with the associated [manuscript](AT URL HERE). It serves to find the dissipation-optimal capacities for networks under cost constraints.

Each script is named after the Figure in the manuscript for whose creation it may be used.

The code is written in *python* and makes use of *numpy, scipy* and *networkx*.
