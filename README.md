# Code accompanying manuscript "Discontinuous transition to loop formation in optimal supply network" by Franz Kaiser, Henrik Ronellenfitsch and Dirk Witthaut

This Computer Code should be used together with the associated [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02910). It serves to find the dissipation-optimal capacities for networks under cost constraints.
